### NoteTracker
- This is a prototype project for an application to allow 
musicians practicing a large number of songs to easily keep 
track of specific sections of songs to work on. In the
prototype, this is accomplished by allowing users to
easily add comments to any location on a piece of music.
These comments are persistent even after the user
selects a different piece of music, an are editable and 
deletable. Additionally, after spending a minute
familiarizing themselves with the program, users should
be able to add comments while simultaneously paying
attention to a conductor or other band director, so
 as to not unnecessarily disrupt rehearsal.

- In a final release, users would additionally be able to
add their own music to the program and create folders to
organize their music. Any comments users add to pieces of
music would also persist between sessions, remaining
in place even when the program is closed.

- To get started using NoteTracker, download the code and
run Main.main(). I created the program using IntelliJ, so
you might be able to use a different IDE, but performance
is not guaranteed.

you have JavaFX installed, please install JavaFX from

before running the code.
